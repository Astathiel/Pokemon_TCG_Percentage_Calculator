2.  **Enter the drop chance:** The script will prompt you to enter the drop chance of the item as a percentage (e.g., `1` for 1%).

3.  **Enter the number of attempts:** Next, you'll be asked to enter the number of times you plan to attempt to get the item.

4.  **View the result:** The script will then output the probability of getting at least one item within the given number of attempts.

## Example

```
Enter the drop chance (e.g., 1 for 1%): 5
Enter the number of attempts: 20
The probability of getting at least one item is: 64.15%
